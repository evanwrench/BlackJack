# BlackJack
## Description
A simulation of the popular casino game Blackjack built using Java. JUnit is used for testing and Swing used for the GUI. The user is a player in the game,
and the dealer is automated by the program. The goal of this program is to allow the user to do anything they would be able to do in a real casino. Some
future improvements to the program that will help with this goal are:
- Allowing the user to "split" and "double down", two options possible in real Blackjack
- Saving the state of the game, so you would keep the same amount of funds between game sessions
- Allowing multiple players at the "table" at the same time
